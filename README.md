Gecko Task
===============================

### Implementation

This test has been developed using no framework. Autoload generated by composer enabled all the classes that have been created to be loaded and used by means of namespaces. 

The codebase adhered to using interfaces and abstract classes from within the Common directory.

A generic calculation service had been built to calculate the raw measurement value response which is returned from within the CalculateService class specific for manipulating the value response, allowing the abstracted General Service to be used for other purposes.  

Unit tests have been carried out within the codebase using the reflection approach.

### How to test

1. Install Composer locally by running `composer install` from the root of the project from the terminal.
2. Unit tests have been implemented using PHP Unit, to execute these please cd to the root directory and run the following command `./vendor/bin/phpunit tests`.

*If no classes seem to load please try and run `composer dump-autoload`.
